_Usage_
__Rebuilding__
Edit compile.sh as necessary for the specific architecture desired, current python versions, and desired software. Then run compile.sh to generate a ChRoot-based Funtoo (enhanced Gentoo) installation, with desktop environment software.

__Persistent Files__
The "packages" and "distfiles" directories should also be copied to the Config directory, for rebuilds of the ChRoot environment.

__Binary Packages__
Live "packages" directory should be made available by unprivileged SSH account for PORTAGE_BINHOST. See http://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Binary_package_guide#PORTAGE_BINHOST for syntax and instructions.

__Images__
Tarball images should be moved from the ChRoot folder to a separate Images directory. Images should be rebuilt upon major updates to the ChRoot environment, and unpacked to create filesystems for new Funtoo/Gentoo machines.

__Maintenance__
Ideally, a binary package server should be kept up-to-date. Otherwise, new images, and binary packages for the latest software, may be simply rebuilt with compile.sh.
